Purpose - To build a platform that provides relevant cryptocurrency information that help consumers make educated and calculated investment decisions. Provide real time data of coin values including

PRICE - 24 HOUR HIGH - 24 HOUR LOW - 24 HOUR CHANGE

Insta.Crypto SlackBot - In order to keep up with the most relevant information in a most convenient way possible we took it a step further and created a slack bot that feeds live information such as coin values and important news information directly to any device that supports Slack.

Future Integrations:
Buy / Sell Trade features 
Set custom slack alerts when prices reach desired values
Automated Investing (Set amount and bot purchases/ sells automatically)

Challenges
We have some challenges that we had to over come as a team with HTML formatting and creating a product that meets our minimum requirements. 

API database limits. When pulling information too many times too quickly to view changes the database would occasionally hesitate to feed data.

Earning Potential 

Short term plan is to generate traffic to website by providing free cryptocurrency information to consumers. Once enough traffic is populated the 2 ad spaces can generate income based on how much traffic is moving on the site. This can be done either be Google AdSense or individual agreements with companies.

Long term plan is to incorporate a BUY/SELL/TRADE feature and charge a small % fee per transaction.

Ideal goal is to generate income through the automated BUY/SELL/TRADE bot that generates transactions automatically, resulting in residual earnings.
